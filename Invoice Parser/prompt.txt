### Input Invoice Data (Text):
{invoiceDATA}

### Context:
- The provided invoice data is in text format, extracted from a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file.
- The text content represents the raw information contained within the invoice.
- The goal is to parse and structure this text data into a well-organized JSON format.
- No image processing or OCR is required, as the data is already in text form.

### Objective:
Extract and structure all relevant details from the provided invoice text into a dynamic JSON format. Ensure accuracy, completeness, and support for multilingual invoices.

### Requirements:
1. **Text Data Handling:**
   - Process the provided text data directly.
   - No image decoding or OCR is necessary.
   - Handle potential variations in text formatting and structure.
2. **Extract Key Invoice Sections:**
   - Seller Details: Company name, address, tax IDs (e.g., GSTIN, PAN, VAT).
   - Buyer Details: Customer name, address, tax IDs.
   - Invoice Metadata: Invoice number, date, payment terms, due date.
   - Transport Information: Transporter name, vehicle number, tracking details.
   - Payment Details: Bank name, account number, SWIFT code, IBAN, UPI ID.
   - Additional Metadata: Any extra details present in the invoice.
3. **Tabular Data Extraction:**
   - Extract all itemized rows, ensuring dynamic column headers based on the invoice format.
   - Include every row, even if some values are missing or zero.
4. **Missing Sections:**
   - If a section is unavailable, return "Not Available" instead of skipping it.
5. **Inference:**
   - Infer missing values from context when possible.
   - Extract the total amount directly without recalculation.
6. **Multi-Language Support:**
   - Process invoices in any language and generate the output in the same language.
7. **Dynamic JSON Structure:**
   - Dynamically create fields for any additional details present in the invoice.
   - Avoid using a fixed/predefined JSON format.
8. **JSON Formatting:**
   - Ensure the output is structured, formatted correctly, and error-free for seamless parsing.

### Expected Output:
A fully structured JSON response containing all extracted details from the invoice text, formatted dynamically, and supporting multiple languages.
